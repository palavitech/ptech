# ptech

**ptech** is a lightweight, early-stage Windows command-line tool designed to analyze files and their executions.

While minimal by design, the roadmap aims to make it a helpful utility for workflows such as basic malware triage, specifically Windows-based malware.

> **Note:** This repository contains only documentation and release binaries. The source code is proprietary and not open-source at this time.
