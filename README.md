# ptech

ptech is a lightweight, early-stage Windows command-line tool designed to analyze files and generate basic insights. It uses a plugin-style DLL system to support modular functionality and is intended for internal or controlled external use. While still minimal, roadmap is to make it useful as a supporting utility in workflows such as basic malware triage.
